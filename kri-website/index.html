              To create without stress, to create differently, and to create without the weight of meaning or substance. Meaning emerged later – as the drawing became clearer, so did its conceptual fascination. But, for me, this piece is more about rediscovering the joy of creation than it is about ideas. I've always like drawing eyeballs and used to sketch one every year to keep track of my progress.

               Planning a drawing is generally the most difficult part of the process for me. At times, I feel as if I'm fighting a constant battle against self-doubt and uncertainty. This drawing, however, was an exception. It seemed to come together without the typical tension and concern. The figure's open attitude wonderfully mirrored the late-blooming tulips. It was a joy to draw.

                There's been a chaotic, unsettled feeling in the air, and it's been difficult for me to focus and do the things I used to do easily. Things are frightening and uncertain all over the world, but there is a sense of connectedness and a rethinking of what is important. It feels like things are changing and will never be the same again, but I'm hopeful that new and beautiful things will grow from these ruins, from everything that is broken.

                The Girl with a Wine Glass portrays the individuals and their possible emotions more vividly.  The girl is drinking, and because she has half her face covered her hair, the observer cannot see any move on her face that would suggest what she is thinking or experiencing at that specific moment. Looking at this detail of the glass, we can see that the figure represented is a woman holding a balance. The only difference is that the girl is aware that the glass of wine represents temptation and appears to willfully embrace it.              </p>

                Her grace of movement and appearance, the fluid and flowing glory of pace and tread, the harmony of figure and expression, lift the soul like sweet airs of flute and harp. The flute represents a broken heart. I blow into the flute and use an empty pen to draw a walking portrait.

                While pushing yourself is necessary, there is an element of tension and stress in continually attempting to take what you're doing to the next level. It's crucial, in my opinion, to put what you've learned into reality by going somewhere familiar. It allows you to check how far you've progressed.              </p>

                I feel as if I've been ripped away from the self I've come to know over the years... This piece, which differs from my recent work, represents both a departure and a progression in my life. Making mistakes, as well as coming to grips with those mistakes, has always been a challenge for me. My work represents my desire to preserve as much control over my practise and personal life as pos sible. While striving for perfection or just pleasing others can be motivating and enjoyable, feeling bound by this ideal might feel more like a crutch or protective mechanism than an authentic way of being.

                There's been a noisy, unsettling feeling in the air, and it has been difficult for me to focus and perform the things I was doing easily. Times are frightening and unpredictable all over the world, but there is still a sense of connectivity and a rethinking of what is necessary. It seems like things are changing and would never be the same again, though I'm hopeful that new and beautiful things will emerge from such rubble, from everything that has been broken.              </p>

                The task of titling this item seemed overwhelming to me. Giving your creation a title is a difficult step of the process. The caption is an opportunity to add words to the image and nudge it in a specific direction. You want to do the work fair without restricting its possibilities by locking it in. But the more I sought to give it wings, the more I discovered I was just exposing my personal boundaries in relation to the art. Something great happens when you let go of a work and share it. It becomes a minor puzzle piece in the artistic process of others. Thank you for taking part in this process and giving your opinions on the work.

                You must embrace faith, let go of some of your fears, slow down your reactions to situations, and increase your empathy and awareness. Your outbursts will become less frequent and less intense if you don't take everything personally and embrace change.              </p>

                The character is winged, chained, and faceless all at the same time. She pulls on her bindings, expecting to release herself, but they simply tighten around her. I hope you like it.

                No one can change his or her past, but the future is what a person makes it to be. Try not to live in the past, think of the future. While a person looks behind them to the past, hey will trip in the future, and many opportunities will pass by, unnoticed. Past memories will painfully linger for a while, but the pain will eventually fade, all it takes is two things: time and forgiveness.              </p>

                In the eye of a storm. I breathe. I’m watching the threatening walls of this storm that jeopardizes my perimeter. But, the air is still so I can get myself together. Bracing for the next wave. Desperate, but too indecisive to move. And the walls of the storm are approaching. But I lack the strength. I am not sure I can go through it again and again…

                Healing begins when you stop pretending that your broken body will get better on its own. If you haven't been told this lately... hear it now. You're not alone. You're not without hope. You are a gift. You have worth. You may have failed, but, friend, you are not a failure. Success is marked by your choice to not give up. Everybody cannot see your invisible battle, but that doesn't negate your strength or victory…
